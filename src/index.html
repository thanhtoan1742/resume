        <div>
            I am a graduate from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, major in computer science.
            I having been programming for 7 years. I have experience working as an backend developer for an e-commerce
            platform and cyber security software. I love to deep dive in to a subject and learn from
            first principles to gain the most insights and understandings. I like to work on things
            that can be reasoned logically.
